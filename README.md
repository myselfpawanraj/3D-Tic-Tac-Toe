## 3x3x3 TTT
This is a 3D tic-tac-toe using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. It includes a GUI to make it enjoyable.

Run main.py to play it.

### Rules
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 by 3 by 3 squares.
- You are **X**, and your friend (or the computer in this case) is **O**. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

- Right Click to restart a game when the game ends.
- Hit SPACE to toggle between modes.

### Tech Used
- **Python** to code the game
